# Aardvark 2
This simple blog engine works right out of the box and its use couldn't be simpler.

Image embedding works easy too

 I   	| am  	| a  	| table 
 --- 	| --- 	| --- 	| ---
 1 		| 2  	| 3		| 4    
 
as the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables) states:
> Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.
 
## Code
Code can be easily embedded but sadly F# syntax highlighting doesn't work
```fsharp
let funny (a : int) =
	a * 2

```

```javascript
var funny = function(a) {
	return a * 2;
};

```

There's a plugin [PicoSyntaxHighLighter](https://github.com/bricebou/PicoSyntaxHighlighter) that should solve this problem.
